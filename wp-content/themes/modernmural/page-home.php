	      <p>Hi, I'm Jennifer Jeffers, the founder and owner of The Modern Mural and its sister site, <a href="www.thesimplestencil.com" alt="the simple stencil" title="The Simple Stencil">The Simple Stencil</a>. I've always had a love affair with words and encouraging others, so it is a dream come true that since 2004, my "job" is to bring meaningful phrases and words of encouragment into my customers homes and professional spaces. It is with that spirit of bringing beauty into people's lives that I created The Modern Mural.</p>
	      <p>It also brings me joy that The Modern Mural empowers people to create their own custom artwork on their walls. It's a thrill to see what we can create together!</p>
				<p>Here at The Modern Mural, we are proud to offer you the personalized customer service that only a small business like ours could provide. You're a valuable part of our business, and we appreciate you.</p>

				<h1 class="sectionHeader" id="works">How it works</h1>
				<p>Our eco-friendly products are as easy to install as they are good for the environment.  Just clean the surface where it will be installed, line up your mural with the surface, peel the backing just enough to expose about an inch of the adhesive, and gently press the mural to the surface - making sure that it is straight.  Continue to slowly and evenly peel back the liner a few inches at a time and smooth the mural onto the surface with the provided smoothing tool.  Once you finish adhering the mural to the surface, stand back and enjoy your modern mural.</p>
