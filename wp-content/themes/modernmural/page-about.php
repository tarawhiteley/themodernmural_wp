      <p>Hi, I'm Jennifer Jeffers, the founder and owner of The Modern Mural and its sister site, <a href="www.thesimplestencil.com" alt="the simple stencil" title="The Simple Stencil">The Simple Stencil</a>. I've always had a love affair with words and encouraging others, so it is a dream come true that since 2004, my "job" is to bring meaningful phrases and words of encouragment into my customers homes and professional spaces. It is with that spirit of bringing beauty into people's lives that I created The Modern Mural.</p>
      <p>It also brings me joy that The Modern Mural empowers people to create their own custom artwork on their walls. It's a thrill to see what we can create together!</p>
